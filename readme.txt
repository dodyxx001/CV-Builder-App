In this project I learned:
    - useState, useRef hooks

Version 1 took about 10 hours to finish. Implemented in version 1:
- app structure
- basic functionality working
- functional PDF printing
- load example functionality
- clear functionality
- file uploading functionality

Version 2 includes:
- corrected input - description
- added color-theme changing functionality
- corrected bug of delete buttons - no more error-throwing
